-   `Total` - number of trips with origin at each district
-   `Walk` - number of walking trips
-   `Bike` - number of bike trips
-   `Car` - number of car trips. Includes taxi and motorcycle.
-   `PTransit` - number of Public Transit trips
-   `Other` - number of other trips (truck, van, tractor, aviation)
-   `Distance` - average trip distance (km)
-   `Duration` - average trip duration (minutes)

### Import dataset

```{r}
data = readRDS("../data/IMOBmodel.Rds")
data_continuous = data |> select(-Origin_dicofre16, -internal, -Lisboa) # Exclude categorical variables
```

Show summary statistics

```{r}
skim(data)
```

The dependent variable is continuous.

## Check the assumptions

Before running the model, you need to check if the assumptions are met.

1.  The dependent variable is normally distributed
2.  Linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables
3.  No multicollinearity between independent variables (or only very little)
4.  The observations are independent
5.  Constant Variance (Assumption of Homoscedasticity)
6.  Residuals are normally distributed

## Assumption 1: Normal distribution

The Dependent Variable is be normally distributed.

Check the histogram of `Car_perc`:

```{r}
hist(data$Car_perc)
```

If the sample is small (\< 50 observations), we use **Shapiro-Wilk** test:

```{r}
shapiro.test(data$Car_perc)
```

If not, use the **Kolmogorov-Smirnov** test:

```{r}
ks.test(
  data$Car_perc,
  "pnorm",
  mean = mean(data$Car_perc),
  sd = sd(data$Car_perc)
)
```

The null hypothesis for both tests is that the distribution is normal.
Therefore, for the distribution to be normal, the pvalue must be **\> 0.05** and the null hypothesis is not rejected.
From the output obtained we can assume normality.

## Assumption 2: Linear relationship

There is a linear relationship between dependent variable (DV) and independent variables (IV).

We can check this assumption by plotting scatterplots of the DV against each IV:

```{r}
#| eval: false
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$Total, xlab = "Car_perc (%)", ylab = "Total (number of trips)")  
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$Walk, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "Walk")  
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$Bike, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "Bike")  
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$Car, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "Car")  
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$PTransit, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "PTransit")
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$Other, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "Other")
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$Distance, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "Distance")
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$Duration, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "Duration")
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$N_INDIVIDUOS, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "N_INDIVIDUOS")
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$Male_perc, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "Male_perc")
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$IncomeHH, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "IncomeHH")
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$Nvehicles, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "Nvehicles")
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$DrivingLic, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "Driving License")
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$CarParkFree_Work, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "Free car parking at work")
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$PTpass, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "PTpass")
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$internal, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "internal trips")
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$Lisboa, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "Lisboa")
plot(x = data$Car_perc, y = data$Area_km2, xlab = "Car_perc", ylab = "Area_km2")
```

Or you can make a pairwise scatterplot matrix, that compares every variable with each other:

```{r}
# pairs(data_continuous, pch = 19, lower.panel = NULL) # we have too many variables, let's split the plots
pairs(data_continuous[,1:6], pch = 19, lower.panel = NULL)
pairs(data_continuous[,7:12], pch = 19, lower.panel = NULL)
pairs(data_continuous[,13:17], pch = 19, lower.panel = NULL)
```

## Assumption 3: No multicollinearity

Check the [correlation plot](eda.qmd#correlations) before choosing the variables.

### Declare the model

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Use `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `C` to comment/uncomment lines (variables)
:::

```{r}
# names(data) # to see the names of the variables

model = lm(
  Car_perc ~ Total +
    Walk +
    Bike +
    Car +
    PTransit +
    Other +
    Distance + 
    Duration + 
    N_INDIVIDUOS + 
    Male_perc + 
    IncomeHH + 
    Nvehicles + 
    DrivingLic + 
    CarParkFree_Work + 
    PTpass + 
    internal + 
    Lisboa + 
    Area_km2,
  data = data
)

summary(model)
```

### Assessing the model

1.  First check the **pvalue** and the **F statistics** of the model to see if there is any statistical relation between the dependent variable and the independent variables.
    If pvalue \< 0.05 and the F statistics \> Fcritical = 2.39, then the model is statistically acceptable.

2.  The **R-square** and **Adjusted R-square** evaluate the amount of variance that is explained by the model.
    The difference between one and another is that the R-square does not consider the number of variables.
    If you increase the number of variables in the model, the R-square will tend to increase which can lead to overfitting.
    On the other hand, the Adjusted R-square adjust to the number of independent variables.

3.  Take a look at the **t-value** and the Pr(\>\|t\|).
    If the t-value \> 1.96 or Pr(\>\|t\|) \< 0.05, then the IV is statistically significant to the model.

4.  To analyse the **estimates** of the variables, you should first check the **signal** and assess if the independent variable has a direct or inverse relationship with the dependent variable.
    It is only possible to evaluate the **magnitude** of the estimate if all variables are continuous and standardized or by calculating the elasticities.
    Do not forget to access the **Intercept**...

We can see from the output that the R-squared value for the model (with ALL variables) is **0.7772**.
We can also see that the overall F-statistic is **42.06** and the corresponding p-value is **\<2.2e-16**, which indicates that the overall regression model is significant.
Also, the predictor variables `DrivingLic` and `CarParkFree_Work`, `internal(No)` and `Lisboa(Yes)` are statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level.

### Your turn

Now try to remove some variables from the model and assess it again.
Elaborate a justification to exclude those variables.
:::

### Calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)

We use the `vif()` function from the car package to calculate the VIF for each predictor variable in the model:

```{r}
car::vif(model)
```

A common rule of thumb is that a VIF value greater than 5 indicates a high level of multicollinearity among the predictor variables, which is potentially concerning.

### Condition index

Condition index is another diagnostic tool for detecting multicollinearity, with values above 10 indicating moderate multicollinearity and values above 30 indicating severe multicollinearity.
You will learn how to to that in the next class: [Factor analysis](factor-analysis.qmd).

## Assumption 4: Independence of observations

Multiple linear regression assumes that each observation in the dataset is independent.

The error (E) is independent across observations and the error variance is constant across IV

The simplest way to determine if this assumption is met is to perform a Durbin-Watson test, which is a formal statistical test that tells us whether or not the **residuals** (and thus the **observations**) exhibit autocorrelation.

```{r}
durbinWatsonTest(model)
```

::: callout-note
In the Durbin-Watson test, values of the D-W Statistic vary from 0 to 4.

If the values are from 1.8 to 2.2 this means that there is **no autocorrelation** in the model.
:::

**H~0~ (null hypothesis):** There is no correlation among the residuals.
Since p-value \> 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis and we can not discard that there is autocorrelation in the model.

If the observations are not independent, you may consider to treat the observarions as a panel data.

## Assumption 5: Constant Variance (Homoscedasticity)

The simplest way to determine if this assumption is met is to create a plot of standardized residuals versus predicted values.

```{r}
plot(model)
```

For the Residuals, check the following **assumptions**:

-   **Residuals vs Fitted:** This plot is used to detect non-linearity, heteroscedasticity, and outliers.

-   **Normal Q-Q:** The quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot is used to check if the disturbances follow a normal distribution

-   **Scale-Location:** This plot is used to verify if the residuals are spread equally (homoscedasticity) or not (heteroscedasticity) through the sample.

-   **Residuals vs Leverage:** This plot is used to detect the impact of the outliers in the model.
    If the outliers are outside the Cook-distance, this may lead to serious problems in the model.

Try analyzing the plots and check if the model meets the assumptions.

## Assumption 6: Residuals are normally distributed

Assess the Q-Q Residuals plot above.
When the residuals clearly depart from a straight diagonal line, it indicates that they do not follow a normal distribution.

Use a formal statistical test like Shapiro-Wilk or Kolmogorov-Smironov to validate those results.
