You can plot a static map using `plof(sf)`, but you can also create interactive maps.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: false
# data preparation
library(sf)
TRIPSgeo_mun = st_read("https://github.com/U-Shift/MQAT/raw/main/geo/TRIPSgeo_mun.gpkg")
TRIPSgeo = TRIPSgeo_mun |> 
  rename(Municipality = "Concelho") |> 
  st_set_geometry("geometry")
st_write(TRIPSgeo, "data/TRIPSgeo.gpkg", delete_dsn = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#| message: false
library(sf)
TRIPSgeo = st_read("../data/TRIPSgeo.gpkg")

plot(TRIPSgeo) # all variables
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
# one variable at a time
plot(TRIPSgeo["Municipality"])

plot(TRIPSgeo["Total"])

plot(TRIPSgeo["Car"])
```

Interactive maps are useful to explore the data, as you can zoom in and out, and click on the points to see the data associated with them.

There are several R packages to create interactive maps.
For instance, the `tmap` package, the `leaflet` package, and the `mapview` package.

## Mapview

Mapview allows to create quick interactive maps, only by declaring the function `mapview()`.

```{r}
#| fig-format: png
library(mapview)
mapview(TRIPSgeo)
```

To color the points by a variable, you can use the `zcol` argument.

```{r}
#| fig-format: png
mapview(TRIPSgeo, zcol = "Total")
```

As you can see, a color palette is automatically assigned to the **continuous variable**.

Try to use a **categorical variable**.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
mapview(TRIPSgeo,
        zcol = "Municipality", # depending on the variable
        alpha.regions = 0.4, # also add transparency
        color = "white" # border color
        ) 
```

Note that you can change the **basemap**, and click on the geometries to **see the data** associated with them.

You can go crazy with all the options that `mapview` offers.
Please refer to the [documentation](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/articles/mapview_02-advanced.html) to see all the options.

### Export

You can directly export the map as an `html` file or image, using the Viewer panel.

This is the most straightforward solution.

You can also export a map as an html file or image using code.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# install.packages("webshot2") # you will need this

map = mapview(TRIPSgeo, zcol = "Total") # first create an objet with the desired map

mapshot2(map, "data/map.html") # as webpage
mapshot2(map, file = "data/map.png") # as image
```

## Rmarkdown

To include a map on a report, website, paper (any type), you can create an Rmarkdown file.

And include a R code chunk (`ctrl + alt + i`) with a map.
If the output is html, you will get an interactive map on your document!

## Flowmap blue

A way to visualize traffic or travel volumes between areas (OD pairs) is through the online tool [flowmap.blue](https://www.flowmap.blue/in-browser).

But you need to prepare the data so that they are exactly in the requested format.
(See the used [source code](https://github.com/rosamfelix/PGmob360/blob/main/code/flowmap_test.R)).

You need two files:

1.  [locations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosamfelix/PGmob360/refs/heads/main/data/locations.csv)
2.  [flows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosamfelix/PGmob360/refs/heads/main/data/flows_car.csv)

Try to copy and paste the content of these files in the corresponding fields the information about **car** trips in the Lisbon metropolitan area according to @IMOB.

## Try it yourself

Visualize the **public transit** trips in the Lisbon metropolitan area.
([flows_tp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosamfelix/PGmob360/refs/heads/main/data/flows_tp.csv))

-   Which differences do you see between car and public transit trips?

-   How many trips are made daily in public transit with origin or destination in Sintra?
