# aim: tutorial R and RStudio -----------------------------------------------------------------

# 0. Introduce myself

Who am I, and which areas I work most
Why I started using R

r notebook
2 pakages created (slopes, odjittering)
Free and Open Source Software <3
drop my contacts



# 1. Open RStudio

explain the 4 panels

examples in the console:
  3+3
3*3
round(3.14)
round(3.14, 1) #1 digit

## 1.1 Working directory
getwd()
setwd()
Create new project in a existing directory or new directory 


## 1.2 Script

you can have different scrip files! not only with R. See notepad (for instance to take notes for this class), python, RMaekDown.
Depending on what you select, the code will highligth differently with flavors (show import pandas with r and python)

you can also set the colors in global options

comment allways!
ctrl + shift + c # comment
ctrl + shift + r # new section
ctrl + shift + a # arranje 

example
b=1+2*(2-3)


ctrl + enter # run this line
select + ctrl + enter # run selection
# run button will run everythin in the script!

what you write and run is exaclty what you are expected to have. computer will not guess your brain!


# 2. Data structure

TABELA[row, column] or TABELA[case, variable]
c(,, , :)
a = c("Car", "Ped", "Bus") # difference with and without the ""

## 2.1 open Rds
teach the TAB thing # it helps a lot not to typo or to be lost in folder structures!
tab when writing code (vars in table)
() # sometimes if you miss the final bracket, it asks you + ?
""

see what's on the data (environment)


## 2.2 open csv

i prefer txt with tab separator


## 2.3 Type of data
int
num
chr

replace chr to num
make as factor for categorical variables




# 3. Some operations
filter, select
== != < > <= >=
&, |
is.na  !is.na
%in% !%in%

sort, arrange


3.3 simple viz
mean
median
(na.rm = TRUE) # if needed
hist(MODEL$Car_perc)
hist(MODEL$Car_perc, labels = TRUE)
abline(v = median(MODEL$Car_perc))
abline(v = median(MODEL$Car_perc), col = "red")
  


## Pipes !
This_data |> do_this |> do_this ...
change from %>% to |> 

ctrl + shift + m
global options |> code



# 4. left_join

MODEL |> left_join(other_table)

explain that both tables dont need to be the same lenght
(can you explain what can happen when shorter / longer, and opposite?)
when the common name (or names!) are the same 
by


# 5. group_by, summarize, (ungroup())

dar exemplo do left_join com uma tabela que nÃ£o se fez ungroup

summarize sem group_by

TRIPSmode_mun |> group_by(Origin_mun) |> summarise(sum())
